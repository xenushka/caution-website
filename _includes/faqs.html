								The right plan depends on your operating model: how you balance
								control, effort, and recovery assurances.
							</p>
							<!-- <p>Start with your context: what you’re protecting, how often you expect to recover, and how much operational work you want to own.</p> -->
							<!-- <p>Match your situation to the level of control and support you need.</p> -->

								<li>
									<a href="#open-source"
										><strong>Self-hosted open source</strong></a
									>
									is for organizations with dedicated technical resources and
									operational maturity to manage everything themselves — from
									infrastructure and encrypted storage to quorum coordination
									and recovery ceremonies. It gives maximum control at zero
									cost, but requires significant ongoing effort.
								</li>

								<li>
									<a href="#paidplans"><strong>On-demand</strong></a> is for
									individuals, family offices, or small teams who need a safety
									net for critical data without frequent recoveries. For
									example, safeguarding high-value keys, estate records, or
									sensitive archives. You store your own data and pay only if
									recovery is triggered.
								</li>

								<li>
									<a href="#paidplans"><strong>Enterprise</strong></a>
									is for companies that want to reduce operational load and
									increase confidence in their recovery process without adding
									headcount. It includes managed storage, scheduled recoveries,
									guided onboarding, premium support, and predictable timelines
									— making recovery part of your operations without creating
									extra work for your team.
								</li>

								<li>
									<a href="#paidplans"><strong>Dedicated</strong></a> is for
									organizations with nuanced requirements — such as strict
									compliance, jurisdictional controls, or complete isolation. It
									provides a fully private deployment with tailored
									infrastructure and a recovery policy designed specifically for
									your organization.

								Yes. Caution is fully open source, and you can run it yourself
								at no cost. This option is best for organizations with dedicated
								technical resources who are willing to handle everything
								themselves — from setting up infrastructure and managing
								encrypted storage to coordinating quorum members and running
								recovery ceremonies. It offers maximum control, but requires
								significant ongoing effort.

							<p>
								<a href="#paidplans">Enterprise</a> and

								We believe that true security requires transparency and

							</p>
							<p>
								Caution is and will always remain fully open source. We don’t
								sell source code. What we offer commercially is hosting,
								automation, and support for organizations that want the
								assurance of managed operations without giving up control.
