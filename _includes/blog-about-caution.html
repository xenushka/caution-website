<h2>About Caution</h2>

<p>
	Caution is the verifiable compute platform, making it easy to run sensitive
	workloads with cryptographic proof, not blind trust.
</p>
<p>
	Our platform gives developers the simplest path to verifiable, end-to-end
	integrity: portable across clouds and hardware, and free from vendor lock-in,
	complexity, or delay. Whether protecting financial data, securing healthcare
	systems, proving the integrity of AI models, or safeguarding industrial
	control and aeronautical systems, Caution makes it fast to set up and
	effortless to run.
</p>
<p>
	Our team has built and secured some of the world’s highest-risk systems
	through our consulting company,
	<a href="https://distrust.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
		<strong>Distrust</strong></a
	>. This includes vaulting infrastructure at BitGo, Unit410, and Turnkey, as
	well as security work with electrical grid operators, industrial control
	systems, and other mission-critical environments.
