<h2>About Distrust</h2>

<p>The Distrust team has helped build and secure some of the highest-risk systems in the world. This includes vaulting infrastructure at BitGo, Unit410, and Turnkey, as well as security work with electrical grid operators, industrial control systems, and other mission-critical systems.</p>

<p>We've conducted deep security due diligence across most major custodians. Through our experience with organizations that operate under constant threat—where **every class of attack is viable**—we've developed a methodology and set of open source tools designed to defend against even the most sophisticated adversaries.</p>

<p>Today, we're taking the hard-earned lessons from that work and sharing them with the broader community. Our goal is to help others strengthen their security posture by making what we've learned—and the open source tools we've built—available to everyone.</p>
