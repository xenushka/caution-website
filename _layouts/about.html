								<p class="about-team-paragraph">
									Not long ago, most organizations had no practical way to
									verify what their software actually ran in production.
									Critical systems shipped into black boxes. Teams relied on
									trust, assumptions, and hope; attackers relied on that too. We
									set out to change this.
								</p>

								<p class="about-team-paragraph">
									After securing $100B+ across critical infrastructure, we knew
									a different model was possible. We had seen how often systems
									fail when verification is missing and how much work it took
									for any organization to build verifiable compute on its own.
								</p>

								<p class="about-team-paragraph">
									We built Caution to make verifiable compute possible and
									accessible to everyone. Instead of months of deep security
									engineering, teams get reproducible workloads, verifiable
									attestation, and infrastructure designed to reduce attack
									surface in minutes. Proof becomes standard. Blind trust
									becomes obsolete.
								</p>

								<p class="about-team-paragraph">
									Today, Caution is shaping a future where verifiable compute is
									the default for running software. Any organization can know
									exactly what its systems execute and build with real
									confidence.
